### Question 1
Write a function that calculates cumulative distribution function of a binomial random variable.
Compare results from your function with `pbinom()` function.

<br><br>

### Question 2
Write a function that runs simulations to obtain power from a one-sample t-test. Run your function (with number of simulations = 10,000 ) with n=30, delta=0.5, sd=1 and sig.level=0.05. Compare your results with `power.t.test(n = 30, delta = 0.5, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05, type = 'one.sample')`.
